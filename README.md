Question 7: Create a TypeScript function that takes a number as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves with the square of the number after a delay of 1 second.
<br>
Question 8: Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for an array of Promises to resolve and then returns an array of their results.
<br>
Question 9: Create a TypeScript function that uses setTimeout to call a function repeatedly every 2 seconds.
