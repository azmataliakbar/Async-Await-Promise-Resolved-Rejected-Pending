# Understanding Async/Await with Promises
Learn how to master asynchronous programming in TypeScript with async/await and promises. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the concepts of async/await and promises, including how to write clean and maintainable asynchronous code.

## Assignment details
This assignment consists of 10 questions that aim to test your understanding of async/await and promises in TypeScript. The questions cover various scenarios, including resolving and rejecting promises, using callbacks, and chaining promises.

- [Question 1](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/blob/master/Q1/) - Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for 2 seconds and then returns a string "Hello World".
- [Question 2](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q2) - Create a TypeScript function that takes a callback function as an argument and uses setTimeout to call the callback after 1 second.
- [Question 3](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q3) - Write a TypeScript function that returns a Promise that resolves with the value "Resolved!" after 3 seconds.
- [Question 4](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q4) - Create a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for two Promises to resolve and then returns their results as an array.
- [Question 5](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q5) - Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for a Promise to resolve and then logs the result to the console.
- [Question 6](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q6) - Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for a Promise to reject and then logs the error to the console.
- [Question 7](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q7) - Create a TypeScript function that takes a number as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves with the square of the number after a delay of 1 second.
- [Question 8](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q8) - Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for an array of Promises to resolve and then returns an array of their results.
- [Question 9](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q9) - Create a TypeScript function that uses setTimeout to call a function repeatedly every 2 seconds.
- [Question 10](https://github.com/azmataliakbar/Async-Await-Promise-Resolved-Rejected-Pending/tree/master/Q10) - Write a TypeScript function that uses async/await to wait for a Promise to resolve and then returns a new Promise that resolves with the result multiplied by 2.
